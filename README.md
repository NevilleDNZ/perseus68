# perseus68
In digital realms, a hero's quest, Perseus68 meets the test. Like serpents tamed on Medusa's head, It crafts .rpm, .deb, dread shed. From legacy code, a new life led, Each OS conquered, onward sped.

In digital realms, a quest unfolds,  
"Perseus68," the tale it holds.  
A legacy, once left in shade,  
A software unloved, in silence laid.

Like Perseus, brave and true,  
It faces tasks, daunting, new.  
Each platform, a serpent's hiss,  
A Gorgon's challenge, not to miss.

For RHEL, a package .rpm,  
Taming snakes with skill and aplomb.  
In Debian lands, a .deb file born,  
Each victory, like Medusa shorn.

Windows, MacOS, each a foe,  
Perseus68, its prowess show.  
Transforming code, old to gold,  
In modern forms, bold and bold.

Each platform, a serpent's stare,  
Turned to stone in open air.  
Perseus68, the hero's path,  
In binary seas, it charts its math.

From legacy's dark, a light does glean,  
In code and script, a hero seen.  
A quest like old, in new frame cast,  
Perseus68, holds the mast.  

In every file, a triumph's seed,  
In every code, a hero's deed.  
So sing the tale, of bytes and might,  
Of Perseus68, in modern flight.
